## Spring Break

This week we had spring break, for me personally it was a whole bunch of moving from one place to another. In light of New York's 
situation, I was busy getting situated in California. Over the break our group decided that we were gonna be working on FreeCodeCamp.
We will start our weekly meeting once we all get back from the break but instead of meeting in person we will have to meet virtually 
our plan is to start meeting this Wednesday 2.30-3.30. I have started looking at the repository and trying to look through the issues
and familiarize myself abit with the code.
